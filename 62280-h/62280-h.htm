<p>We also have to acknowledge, with thanks, permission from
<span class="smcap">Messrs. Smith</span>, <span
class="smcap">Elder &amp; Co.</span>, to introduce the various
excerpts from Thackeray&rsquo;s Works found in the following
pages.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>THE PUBLISHERS</i>.</p>
<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>I.</h2>
<p>Thackeray does not give the same opportunities for the
identification of his scenes as Dickens.&nbsp; The elaboration
with which the latter localizes his characters, and the
descriptive minuti&aelig; with which he makes their haunts no
less memorable than themselves, are not to be found in the works
of the author of <i>Vanity Fair</i>.&nbsp; No faculty was
stronger in Dickens, or of more service to him, than his power of
word-painting.&nbsp; He reproduces the objects <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>by which the
persons he describes are surrounded with a fidelity which would
be tedious, if it were not relieved by the humor which humanizes
bricks, and imparts a grotesque sort of sensibility to articles
of furniture; and it is not easy to think of any of his leading
characters without being reminded of the neighborhoods in which
they played their parts.</p>
<p>Thackeray, on the contrary, is not topographical.&nbsp; The
briefest mention of a street suffices with him, and it is the
character, not the locality, which has permanence in the
reader&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Every feature of Becky Sharp is
remembered with a vividness which disassociates her with fiction;
but the situation of the little house in which the unfortunate
Rawdon finally discovers her duplicity, in the famous scene with
the Marquis of Steyne, escapes the memory.&nbsp; When the book is
no longer fresh to him, <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>the reader may recollect that after
her marriage she went to live in Mayfair, and may picture to
himself a small, fashionable dwelling in that aristocratic
neighbourhood; but he cannot remember that the author places it
in Curzon street, nor that the Sedleys lived in Russell Square,
Philip in Old Parr street, and Colonel Newcome in Fitzroy
Square.</p>
<p>We have one example in Thackeray of the grotesquely humorous
descriptive power of which Dickens was a master.&nbsp; It hits at
the absurd nomenclature of modern London suburbs, where every box
of a house has some high-sounding name of the sort which
ornaments the fiction of the &ldquo;Chambermaid&rsquo;s
Companion,&rdquo; and it describes the neighbourhood into which
the Sedleys moved after their failure&mdash;&ldquo;St. Adelaide
Villa, Anna Maria Road, West, where the houses look like baby
houses; where the <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>people looking out of the first floor windows must
infallibly, as you think, sit with their feet in the parlors
below; where the shrubs in the little gardens in front bloom with
a perennial display of little children&rsquo;s pinafores, little
red socks, caps, etc. (<i>polyandria polygenia</i>); whence you
hear the sound of jingling spinets and women singing; and
whither, of an evening, you see city clerks plodding
wearily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fanciful supposition that persons in the upper stories
must have their legs on the lower floor is richly characteristic
of the manner in which Dickens would have indicated the smallness
of the houses.&nbsp; It is a touch of that kind of humour which
distinguishes all the work of that author, and which was one of
his most serviceable resources; it gives facial expression to
inanimate objects, and, as we have said, it individualizes the
haunts of his characters <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>no less than the characters
themselves.&nbsp; But it is so rare in Thackeray that the
exhibition of it in this fragment strikes us, as the lurid style
of the earlier writings of Lord Lytton would do if we were to
find a passage from them interpolated among the confiding
garrulities of <i>Vanity Fair</i>.</p>
<p>It was not that Thackeray lacked the power of observation in
the direction of externals,&mdash;though he certainly did not
possess it in the same degree as Dickens&mdash;nor that his
characters were airy visions to him, requiring no other
habitation than the chambers of his brain; they were indeed flesh
and blood to him, and Miss Thackeray has told a friend of the
writer&rsquo;s, <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> how, in her walks with her father, he
would point out the very houses in which they lived.&nbsp; The
difference was principally one <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>of method.&nbsp; Thackeray&rsquo;s was
the classic stage&mdash;a dais with a drapery of green baize,
before the time of scenery.&nbsp; Dickens&rsquo;s was the modern
stage, with lime-lights, trap-doors, and elaborate
&ldquo;sets.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>II.</h2>
<p>Though his other scenes are misty, no reader of Thackeray who
engages in a search for the places which he describes is likely,
however, to overlook the Charterhouse, the ancient foundation to
which he refers again and again, dwelling on it with many fond
reminiscences.&nbsp; It is the school in which he himself was
educated, and he has associated three generations of his
characters with it.&nbsp; Thomas Newcome received instruction
here, also his son Clive, with Pendennis, Osborne, and Philip of
the second generation, after whom came Rawdon Crawley&rsquo;s
little son and young George <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Osborne; and, finally, the dear old
Colonel, when broken down and weary, joined the poor brethren who
are pensioners of the institution, and within its monastic walls
cried <i>Adsum</i> as he heard a voice summoning him to the
everlasting peace.&nbsp; Occasionally it is called
Slaughter-house, once or twice &ldquo;Smiffle&rdquo; (after the
boys&rsquo; way of pronouncing Smithfield, where it is situated);
but in Thackeray&rsquo;s later works he generally speaks of it as
Grayfriars or Whitefriars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It had been,&rdquo; he says in <i>Vanity Fair</i>,
&ldquo;a Cistercian convent in old days when the Smith field,
which is contiguous to it, was a tournament ground.&nbsp;
Obstinate heretics used to be brought thither, convenient for
burning hard by.&nbsp; Henry the Eighth seized upon the monastery
and its possessions, and hanged and tortured some of the monks
who would not <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>accommodate themselves to the pace of his reform.&nbsp;
Finally, a great merchant bought the house and land adjoining, in
which, with the help of other wealthy endowments of land and
money, he established a famous foundation hospital for old men
and children.&nbsp; An extra school grew round the old, almost
monastic foundation, which subsists still with its middle-age
costume and usages; and all Christians pray that it may
flourish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of this famous house some of the greatest noblemen,
prelates and dignitaries in England, are governors; and as the
boys are very comfortably lodged, fed and educated, and
subsequently inducted to good scholarships at the University, and
livings in the Church, many little gentlemen are devoted to the
ecclesiastical profession from their tenderest years, and there
is considerable emulation to procure nominations <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>for the
foundation.&nbsp; It was originally intended for the sons of poor
and deserving clerics and laics; but many of the noble governors
of the institution, with an enlarged and rather capricious
benevolence, selected all sorts of objects for their
bounty.&nbsp; To get an education for nothing, and a livelihood
and profession assured, was so excellent a scheme, that some of
the richest people did not disdain it; and not only the great
men&rsquo;s relations, but great men themselves, sent their sons
to profit by the chance.&nbsp; Right reverend prelates sent their
own kinsmen as the sons of their clergy, while on the other hand
some great noblemen did not disdain to patronize the children of
their confidential servants, so that a lad entering this
establishment had every variety of youthful society wherewith to
mingle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a rule, however, the boys, belong <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>to the upper
classes, and an education obtained at Charterhouse is scarcely
less of a social distinction than the much coveted and costly
preparation of Eton, Harrow, or Winchester.&nbsp; The history of
the school is full of brilliant names, and among its scholars
have been Joseph Addison, Richard Steele, Isaac Barrow, General
Havelock, Sir William Blackstone, Lord Chief Justice
Ellenborough, Lord Liverpool, John Wesley and George Grote.</p>
<p>It is possible that one may know London intimately, and yet be
ignorant of the situation of the Charterhouse.&nbsp; Smithfield
is out of the way of the main lines of traffic: it is a squalid
neighbourhood, north of Ludgate Hill, and it retains its ancient
characteristics more than almost all other parts of the great
city,&mdash;which has been so modernized that Cheapside looks
like a slice of Broadway, and once shabby Fleet <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Street is
showing all sorts of ornamental fronts.&nbsp; It has in it many
solemn brick houses of a blackish purple, with glowing roofs of
red tiles; smaller buildings of an earlier period, with high
peaked gables and overlapping second stories; sequestred alleys,
and courts bearing queer names, and many curious little
shops.</p>
<p>One of the most direct approaches to it is through the Old
Bailey from Ludgate Hill.&nbsp; On this route we pass the austere
granite of Newgate Prison and also Pye Corner, where as the
sign-board of a public house tells us, the great fire of 1666
ended, after burning from the 2nd to the 10th of September; we
also pass Cock Lane, famous for its ghost, and the quaintest of
old London churches, St. Bartholomew the Great, which is hemmed
in and partly extinguished by the surrounding houses, that hide
all but its smoked and <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>patched tower, and a few square feet
of grass, which is justifiably discouraged in its want of
sunshine and space; thence our path is by the extensive buildings
of St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital, about which there is a
morbid activity in the flow of officials and visitors, most of
the latter being slatternly and anxious-looking women, with
babies and baskets on their arms, and from the Hospital we cross
the street, and so through the new cattle market, which fills the
space once occupied by the pens, and covers the spot whence the
souls of many martyrs have passed in flame from the stake to
heaven.</p>
<h2><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>III.</h2>
<p>The buildings form an irregular cluster spread over a prodigal
area, and isolated by a wall of brick and stone which many London
fogs and long days of yellow weather have reduced to the
dismalest of colors.&nbsp; None of them are lofty; some of them
are of granite, and others of brick, upon which age has cast a
smoky mantle.&nbsp; They are separated by wide courts and winding
passages; and when I was there in the Easter vacation these open
spaces were vacant, and the brisk twittering of the sparrows was
the only sound that came from them.&nbsp; The quiet seemed all
the greater, inasmuch as all <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>around the walls is a busy
neighbourhood, full of traffic and voices.&nbsp; The courts are
for the most part paved with small cobblestones, and are cleanly
swept; but some of them are grassy&mdash;grassy in the dingy and
feeble way of London vegetation.&nbsp; These buildings look as
sad as they are old; to the juvenile imagination the high walls
and the severe architecture must be sharply distressing, and many
a boy has felt his heart sink with misgiving as, for the first
time, he has been driven through the old gate-way, to be placed
as a scholar on Thomas Sutton&rsquo;s <a name="citation15"></a><a
href="#footnote15" class="citation">[15]</a> famous
foundation.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>At this
old gate-way, one day, I saw a very feeble old gentleman,
strangely dressed in a scarlet waistcoat and bright blue
trowsers, a brass-buttoned coat, and a high silk hat.&nbsp; He
was very small and very weak, moving slowly with the help of a
stick, and coughing painfully behind his pocket
handkerchief.&nbsp; To my question as to the admission of
strangers, he said, quaveringly: &ldquo;If you are a patron, you
may see the buildings, but you had better ask the janitor; there
he is.&nbsp; I,&rdquo; he added, with some hesitation, &ldquo;I
am one of the poor brethren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old head bowed down with years and sorrow, the white hair,
the troublesome cough, the courteous amiability of manner,
reminded me of Colonel Newcome&mdash;Codd Newcome, as the boys
began to call him; and, indeed, this old gentleman had been a
captain in the Queen&rsquo;s service, as the <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>janitor
afterward told us, though he was not as stately nor as handsome
as the dear old Colonel was.&nbsp; None of the celebrities of
Charterhouse possesses the same vivid interest, the same hold
upon our sympathies, the same command of the affections, as the
brave, high-minded, large-hearted old soldier, who sacrificed all
he had in the world to keep his honour spotless, and to shield
others from misery.</p>
<p>As the janitor took us from hall to hall in the dark, monastic
buildings, Colonel Newcome was constantly before us, and his
figure, even more than that of Thackeray himself, filled our
minds, and made us feel kindly to the old pensioners who were
sunning themselves at the doors of their rooms, or were gathered
in a quiet corner of one of the courts, chatting or reading.</p>
<p>The pensioners, of whom there are eighty, <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>remain in the
old buildings, in which each of them has a sitting-room and a
bed-room, with a servant to wait upon him.&nbsp; Their table is a
common one, in a grand old dining-hall, and twice a day they don
their gowns to go to service in the little chapel, to thank God
for his manifold blessings and mercies.&nbsp; But the boys have
been removed since 1870 to a magnificent new-school at Godalming,
Surrey, thirty-four miles away from London fogs and the crowds of
Smithfield, and they have taken nearly all the relics of
Thackeray with them, including the little bed in which he slept
while a scholar.&nbsp; Their part of the buildings is now
occupied by the Merchant Taylors&rsquo; School, which has added a
large new schoolroom to the square.&nbsp; The ground is immensely
valuable, and from an economic point of view it seems a waste to
devote it to the obsolete buildings which <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>fill the
greater part of it.&nbsp; Soon, no doubt, another home will be
found for the poor brethren, and when commerce takes possession
of Charterhouse Square, one of the most interesting piles in
London town will disappear. <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a></p>
<p>The cleanliness and orderliness which leave no scrap of waste
or wisp of straw or ridge of dust visible in the approach have
also swept up every part of the interior; and though the smoke
and dust have taken a tenacious hold, the charwoman&rsquo;s <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>besom and
scrubbing-brush have been vigorously applied.&nbsp; The buildings
look quite as old as they are.&nbsp; The oaken wainscoting is the
deepest brown; the balusters and groining are massive and carved;
the tapestries are indistinct and phantasmal, like faded
pictures, and the walls are like those of a fortress.&nbsp; It is
easy in these surroundings to conjure up visions of the middle
ages.</p>
<p>The site of the dormitories of the Charterhouse boys is now
occupied by the new school-room of the Merchant Taylors; but
looking upon it is a dusky cloister, once given to the prayerful
meditations of the friars, which in Thackeray&rsquo;s time and
later was used for games of ball; the gloom is everywhere.&nbsp;
The ghosts of the silent brothers seem fitter tenants than the
boys with shining faces and ringing voices.&nbsp; There are
narrow, suspicious-looking <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>passages, and heavily-barred,
irresistible oaken doors.&nbsp; But these corridors and barriers
against the unwelcome lead into several apartments of truly
magnificent size and faded splendour.&nbsp; The dining-hall of
the poor brethren has wainscoting from twelve to twenty feet
high, a massively groined roof, a musicians&rsquo; gallery with a
carved balustrade, and a large fire-place framed in ornamental
oak, over which the Sutton arms are emblazoned; while at the end
of the room is a portrait of the founder, dressed in a flowing
gown and the suffocatingly frilled collar of his time.&nbsp;
Parallel to this, and accessible by a low door, is the
dining-hall of the gown boys, a long, narrow room, with a very
low ceiling, high wainscoting, a knotty floor, insufficient
windows, and another large fire-place inclosed by an elaborate
mantel-piece of oak.&nbsp; Here almost side by side, these boys
with life <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>untried before them and the old men well-nigh at their
journey&rsquo;s end, ate the bread provided for them by their
common benefactor, and joined voices in thanksgiving; here still
the old pensioners assemble, and in trembling voices murmur grace
over the provision made for them.&nbsp; Upstairs there is a
banqueting-hall, which is not inferior in sombre grandeur to that
of the poor brothers, and was once honoured by the presence of
Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; It also is wainscoted and groined, and
hung with tapestries, out of which the pictures have nearly
vanished.&nbsp; The fire-place is the finest of all, and above it
some hazy paintings are lost in the shadow.</p>
<p>Thackeray was one of the foundation scholars, and lived in the
school, and wore a gown.&nbsp; He was, from all accounts, an
average boy, undistinguished by industry or precocious
ability.&nbsp; He was very much <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>like many of Dr. Birch&rsquo;s little
friends: a simple honest, and sometimes mischievous lad.&nbsp;
Though he was never elected orator or poet, he wrote parodies,
and was clever with a pencil, which he used with no little fancy
and humour.&nbsp; The margins of books and scraps of paper of all
kinds were covered with sketches, most of them caricatures; and
it is said to have been a familiar thing to see the artist
surrounded by an admiring crowd of his school-fellows, while he
developed, with grotesque extravagance and never-failing effect,
the outlines of some juvenile hero or some notability of
history.&nbsp; The head master of the school was severe, and as
Thackeray was very sensitive, it is supposed that his school days
were not of the happiest.&nbsp; But he bore the old foundation no
ill-will; who, indeed, shall ever do it more honor than he has
done?</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Only a
few weeks before his death, Thackeray was present on
Founder&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp; He sat in his usual back seat in the
old chapel.&nbsp; He went thence to hear the oration in the
governor&rsquo;s room, and, as he walked up to the orator with
his contribution, was received with hearty applause.&nbsp; At the
banquet afterward, he sat at the side of his old friend and
school-mate John Leech; and Thackeray it was who, on that
occasion proposed the toast of &ldquo;The
Charterhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking us through the grounds by the way of Wash-house Court,
a quadrangle of very old and smoky buildings, which were attached
to the original monastery, the janitor conducted us into the cool
and quiet cloister which leads into the chapel.&nbsp; Here is the
handsome memorial of the Carthusians slain in the wars, and on
the walls is a commemorative tablet to Thackeray.&nbsp; <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Next to
Thackeray&rsquo;s is a similar tablet to the memory of Leech.</p>
<p>The little chapel is much as it was in their time and long
before.&nbsp; The founders&rsquo; tomb, with its grotesque
carvings, monsters, heraldries, still darkles and shines with the
most wonderful shadows and lights, as Thackeray described
it.&nbsp; There, in marble effigy, lies Fundator Noster in his
ruff and gown, awaiting the great examination day.&nbsp; Just in
front of this elaborate monument, Thackeray himself used to sit
when a boy.&nbsp; The children are present no more; but yonder,
twice a day, sit the pensioners of the hospital, listening to the
prayers and the psalms,&mdash;four-score of the old reverend
black gowns.&nbsp; The custom of the school was that, on the
twelfth of December, the head gown boy should recite a Latin
oration; and, though the scholars are removed to Godalming, the
ceremony is <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>perpetuated.&nbsp; Many old Carthusians attend this
oration; after which they go to chapel and hear a sermon, which
is followed by a dinner, at which old condisciples meet, old
toasts are given, and speeches are made.&nbsp; The reader has
surely not forgotten how Pendennis, himself a Grayfriars boy,
came to the festival one day quite unaware of his friend&rsquo;s
presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pensioners were in their benches, the boys in their
places, with young fresh faces and shining white collars.&nbsp;
We oldsters, be we ever so old,&rdquo; Pendennis has written,
&ldquo;become boys again as we look at that old familiar tomb,
and think how the seats are altered since we were here, and how
our doctor&mdash;not the present doctor, the doctor of <i>our</i>
time&mdash;used to sit yonder, and his awful eye used to frighten
us shuddering boys on whom it lighted; and how the boy next us
<i>would</i> kick our <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>shins during service time, and how
the monitor would cane us afterwards, because our shins were
kicked.&nbsp; Yonder sit forty cherry-cheeked boys, thinking
about home and holidays to-morrow.&nbsp; Yonder sit the
pensioners coughing feebly in the twilight.&nbsp; Is Codd Ajax
alive you wonder?&mdash;the Cistercian lads called these old
gentlemen Codds, I know not wherefore&mdash;but is old Codd Ajax
alive I wonder? or Codd soldier? or kind old Codd gentleman? or
has the grave closed over them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A plenty of candles light up this chapel, and this
scene of age and youth, and early memories, and pompous
death.&nbsp; How solemn the well-remembered prayers are, here
uttered again in the place where in childhood we used to listen
to them.&nbsp; How beautiful and decorous the rite, how noble the
ancient words of the supplications which the priest utters, and
to which generations <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>of fresh children, and troops of
by-gone seniors have cried Amen! under those arches!&nbsp; The
service for Founder&rsquo;s Day is a special one; one of the
Psalms selected being the thirty-seventh, and we hear:&mdash;23.
&lsquo;The steps of a good man are ordered by the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>; and He delighteth in His way.&nbsp;
24. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> upholdeth him with his
hand.&nbsp; 25. I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not
seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging
bread.&rsquo;&nbsp; As we came to this verse, I chanced to look
up from my book toward the swarm of black-coated pensioners, and
amongst them&mdash;amongst them&mdash;sat Thomas
Newcome.&rdquo;&nbsp; The noble old man had come to end his days
here, and we know of no chapter in English literature more
affecting than that in which his light is put out, and he softly
murmurs <i>Adsum</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Tears
often refuse to flow when manhood has blunted the sympathies, and
we are unmoved when we read again the books which summoned
copious floods in youth, but the pathos of Colonel
Newcome&rsquo;s death, never loses its effect; it is so deep and
genuine, that the description starts our grief anew whenever we
read it, and it leaves us with an acute sense of profound
bereavement.&nbsp; We feel a tender interest in the poor
brothers, and a high respect for them, because the Colonel was
one of them, and because Thackeray, in his imperishable prose,
has made them representative of honorable but unfortunate old
age. <a name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"

30</span>Charterhouse is the centre of a neighbourhood which
Dickens chose for many of his scenes, as the reader of this
knows.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only a wall,&rdquo; says Thackeray, in <i>Mr.
and Mrs. Frank Berry</i>, &ldquo;separates the playground, or
&lsquo;green,&rsquo; as it was called in his time, from
Wilderness Row and Goswell street.&nbsp; Many a time have I seen
Mr. Pickwick look out of his window in that street, though we did
not <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>know
him then.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not only of Mr. Pickwick, but of many
other characters, do we find reminiscences in Smithfield.&nbsp;
The Sarah Son&rsquo;s Head, as John Browdy called it, Snow Hill,
Saffron Hill, Fleet Lane, and Kingsgate street are not far
away.&nbsp; The buildings with the ancient fronts, the idlers at
the corners, and the confusing little alleys, which lead where no
one would expect them to lead, all belong to Dickens&rsquo;s
London.&nbsp; The miserable associations of his early life, his
interest in the poor, and his relish for the grotesque, drew him
into the shady and disreputable quarters of the city; and the
student of his works can track him with greater ease and ampler
results in neighbourhoods like Smithfield than in the West
End.&nbsp; With Thackeray, the reverse is the case; and,
excepting Charter-house, the reader who desires to <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>identify his
localities finds little to reward him in a search east of Pall
Mall, or south of Oxford street.</p>
<h2><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>IV.</h2>
<p>On the site of the Imperial Club in Cursitor street, Chancery
Lane, stood a notorious &ldquo;sponging house,&rdquo; to which
Rawdon Crawley was taken when arrested for debt, immediately
after leaving the brilliant entertainment given by the Marquis of
Steyne, and from which he wrote an ill-spelled letter to his wife
(who had appeared triumphantly in some charades at that
entertainment), begging her to send some money for his
release.&nbsp; The reader remembers how the faithless little
woman answered,&mdash;assuring him of her grief and anxiety, and
telling him that she had not <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the money, but would get it; though,
as poor, blundering, soft-hearted Rawdon discovered afterward,
she had a very large sum at the moment she wrote to him, and did
not send him any of it because she wished to keep him in jail
that she might intrigue with the licentious old marquis; and the
reader will remember that Rawdon was released at the instance of
his cousin&rsquo;s wife, and went to the little house in Curzon
street, where he surprised his deceitful spouse, and nearly
murdered her companion, the same old Marquis of Steyne, knight of
the garter, lord of the powder-box, trustee of the British
Museum, etc.</p>
<p>When we come to the end of that passage, we put the book on
our lap and lean back in the chair, and, while we are still
glowing with the excitement of the scene, we are filled with
admiration of the genius which produced it.&nbsp; How did
Thackeray <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>achieve his effects?&nbsp; Becky Sharp is a unique and
permanent figure in literature, a subtle embodiment of duplicity,
ambition, and selfishness.&nbsp; She is avaricious, hypocritical,
specious, and crafty.&nbsp; Though not malignant nor to a
certainty criminal, she is a conscienceless little malefactor,
whose ill deeds are only limited by the ignoble dimensions of her
passions.&nbsp; She lies with amazing glibness, is utterly
faithless to her hulking husband, and utterly indifferent to her
child.&nbsp; Her mendacity is superlative, and double-dealing
enters into all her transactions.&nbsp; But she is so shrewd, so
vivacious, so artful, so immensely clever and good-humoured, she
has so much prettiness of manner and person, that, while we
despise her, and have not the least pity for her when retribution
falls heavily upon her, our indignation against her is not so
great as we feel that it ought to be, principally <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>because her
sins have a certain feminine archness and irresponsibility in
them, which keeps them well down to the level of comedy.&nbsp;
When we close the book we know her through and through, and
thoroughly understand all the complex workings of her strategic
mind.&nbsp; How do we know her so well?&nbsp; Thackeray is not
exegetical, and does not depend on elaborate analysis for his
effects.&nbsp; The actions of the characters are themselves fully
expository, and do not call for any outside comments or
enlargement on the part of the author.&nbsp; This is the case to
such an extent that, when we examine the completeness with which
the characters are revealed to us, we are inclined to believe
that Thackeray&rsquo;s art is of the very highest kind, and that,
though in form it is undramatic, intrinsically it is powerfully
dramatic.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>But we
are straying from our purpose, which is simply to look for
ourselves at the places which he has described.&nbsp; Across the
way from the bottom of Chancery Lane is the Temple, to the
interest of which he has added many associations.&nbsp; He was
fond of its dark alleys, archways, courts, and back stairs.</p>
<p>In 1834 he was called to the bar, and for some time he
occupied chambers in the venerable buildings with the late Tom
Taylor.&nbsp; His rooms, which were at number 10 Crown Office
Row, have disappeared before &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; that
present a modern front to the gardens and the river.&nbsp; Philip
had chambers in the Temple, and there, also, in classic
Lamb&rsquo;s Court, Pendennis and Warrington were located.</p>
<p>Warrington smoking his cutty pipe, and writing his
articles&mdash;the fine-hearted fellow, the unfortunate
gentleman, the unpedantic <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>scholar, who took Pendennis by the
hand and introduced him to Grub street when that young
unfortunate came to the end of his means.&nbsp; George Warrington
teaches us a new lesson in manhood, in patience, in
self-abnegation.&nbsp; His lot is full of sorrow, his cherished
ambitions are impossible, through no fault of his own, but it is
not in him to surrender to &ldquo;the dull gray life and
apathetic end,&rdquo;&mdash;his contentment is the repose of a
generous nature, his cheeriness with his pipe and his work
springs out of a calmly philosophic mind, a satisfied conscience,
a profound faith, and when we pass through Lamb&rsquo;s court,
not least in our affections is the shadow of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man of letters cannot but love the place which has
been inhabited by so many of his brethren, and peopled by their
creations as real to us at this day, as the authors whose
children they <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>were,&rdquo; and says Thackeray.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir Roger
de Coverley walking in the Temple garden, and discoursing with
Mr. Spectator about the beauties in hoops and patches who are
sauntering over the grass, is just as lively a figure to me, as
old Samuel Johnson rolling through the fog with the Scotch
gentleman at his heels, on their way to Mr. Goldsmith&rsquo;s
chambers in Brick court, or Harry Fielding, with inked ruffles
and a wet towel round his head, dashing off articles at midnight
for the <i>Covent Garden Journal</i>, while the printer&rsquo;s
boy is asleep in the passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the Temple, we once more enter Smithfield, to look for
the site of the old Fleet prison, the scene of many episodes in
the stories of Dickens.&nbsp; It was in this strange place, that
the brilliant, but thriftless Captain Shandon lived, &ldquo;one
of the wisest, wittiest, and most incorrigible of <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>Irishmen;&rdquo; here Pendennis found him sitting on a
bed, in a torn dressing gown, with a desk on his knees: here a
prisoner for debt, he indited the prospectus of the <i>Pall Mall
Gazette</i>, which was so called, he said, because its editor was
born in Dublin, and the sub-editor (excellent Jack Finucane) at
Cork; because the proprietor lived in Paternoster Row, and the
paper was published in Catherine Street, Strand.&nbsp; This
imaginary title of Thackeray&rsquo;s was not the only one
afterwards adopted by a real newspaper.&nbsp; He writes of the
<i>Whitehall Review</i> as an opposing print, and that is now the
name of a successful London journal.</p>
<p>The Fleet is a thing of the past, and the attributes of
Captain Shandon have no inheritors in the press of to-day.&nbsp;
A knight armed cap-&agrave;-pie in Cheapside, would not be a more
antiquated figure, than the <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>boozy scholar editing a reputable
journal in the cell of a prison.&nbsp; Journalism has taken off
its soft hat and shabby clothes; it has mended its erring and
improvident ways, and put on the manners of polite society.&nbsp;
Not in a tap-room, with jorums of hot whiskey, Welsh rabbits, and
devilled chops does the modern scribe regale himself.&nbsp; He
has a club somewhere in Adelphi, or St. James&rsquo;, where he
presents himself in sedate evening dress, he turns pale at the
very mention of supper, and, instead of singing old English
songs, sadly compares notes with his fellow-dyspeptics.&nbsp; A
vulgar public-house, or low music hall stands on the site of the
Haunt and the Back Kitchen.&nbsp; When Warrington, Pendennis, Tom
Sarjeant, Clive Newcome, and Fred. Bayham frequented the Haunt,
and joined in the diversions of the literary democracy, there was
a superstition among them, that <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the place vanished at the approach of
daybreak, that when Betsy turned the gas off at the door lamp, as
the company went away, the whole thing faded into mist&mdash;the
door, the house, the bar, Betsy, the beer-boy, Mrs. Nokes, and
all.&nbsp; Whether this was so or not, it has now vanished, not
for a day, but for ever, like Captain Shandon, and the wild
Bohemianism of his time. <a name="citation42"></a><a

<h2><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>It is only a minutes&rsquo; walk from the corner of Fleet
Lane, to the street of booksellers, Paternoster Row, in which the
rival publishers, Bungay and Bacon lived&mdash;Bacon in an
ancient low-browed building, with a few of his books displayed in
the windows under a bust of my Lord Verulam; and Bungay in the
house opposite, which was newly painted, and elaborately
decorated in the style of the seventeenth century, &ldquo;so that
you might have fancied stately Mr. Evelyn passing over the
threshold, or curious Mr. Pepys examining the books in the
windows.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>The</i> Row, so called&mdash;as <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>financiers
arrogantly call Wall Street, <i>the</i> Street&mdash;is not wider
than an alley way, and in this respect it is exactly as it was
when Warrington introduced Pendennis to the editor of the
<i>Parlor Table Annual</i>, wherein his verses were
published.&nbsp; But though its breadth has not been increased,
the old buildings on both sides of it have given place in many
instances to towering new ones, five and six stories high, which
shut out the light, and keep the editors, compilers, printers,
engravers, and book-binders, who are the principal laborers of
the Row, in an all-day gloom.&nbsp; Both Bungay and Bacon had
their domestic establishments over their shops, and their wives,
who were sisters, thus had an opportunity to insult one another
by looks and mute signs from their opposite windows.&nbsp; Bungay
and Bacon, and their belligerent spouses are now out of the
trade, and the annual <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span><i>Souvenirs</i> and <i>Keepsakes</i>
which made a part of their business, belong to an extinct form of
literature.&nbsp; The Row is full of Grub Street curiosities; but
Lady Fanny Fantail, Miss Bunion, and the Honorable Percy Popinjay
are seen within its precincts no more, and if they still exist,
they probably find a new field for their distinguished services
in the society papers.</p>
<p>Let anyone strike out which way he will from Fleet Street, he
is sure to find himself in the presence of something which
reminds him of Dickens, near some object which his humor has made
famous, or which answers to one of his luminous descriptions.</p>
<p>The slums between the Strand and Soho, and between Smithfield
and Clerkenwell, were fertile to him, and not a <i>gamin</i>
there knew the winding alleys, and crisscross streets better than
the gentleman <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>with the high complexion, the sparkling eye, the
iron-gray beard, the well-cut dress, and the brisk step, who
might have been seen speeding through them at all sorts of
unusual hours.&nbsp; One day, he was heard of in Ratcliff
Highway, or among the riverside shanties of Poplar, and the next,
among the bird shops of Seven Dials, or in the courts of
Lambeth.&nbsp; When we contrast the little we have found of
Thackeray in the neighbourhood through which we have just been,
with the variety and suggestiveness of the reminiscences of
Dickens in the same region, our search seems disappointing.</p>
<p>As we have said Thackeray was not a novelist of low
life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he says in the preface to
<i>Pendennis</i>: &ldquo;the lovers of excitement may care to
know that this book began with a very precise plan, which was
entirely put aside.&nbsp; Ladies and Gentlemen, <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>you were to
have been treated, and the writer&rsquo;s and publisher&rsquo;s
pocket benefited by the recital of the most active horrors.&nbsp;
What more exciting than a ruffian (with many admirable virtues)
in St. Giles, visited constantly by a young lady from
Belgravia?&nbsp; What more stirring than the contrasts of
society?&nbsp; The mixture of slang and fashionable
language?&nbsp; The escapes, the battles, the murders? . . . .
The exciting plan was laid aside (with a very honorable
forbearance on part of the publishers) because on attempting it,
I found that I failed from want of experience of my subject; and
never having been intimate with any convict in my life, and the
manners of ruffians and gaol-birds being quite unfamiliar to me,
the idea of entering into competition with M. Eugene Sue was
abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>VI.</h2>
<p>Though in the east end of the town and in the south, Thackeray
has left few footsteps, for us to follow, in ancient and
comfortable Bloomsbury, and the region to the west of it and
north of Oxford street (called De Quincey&rsquo;s step-mother),
we find much to remind us of him.&nbsp; It was in Russell Square
that the Sedleys lived in the time of their prosperity, and
thence, on the evening after the arrival of gentle Amelia from
the boarding school at Chiswick, a messenger was sent for George
Osborne, whose house was No. 96.&nbsp; Russell Square is the
largest and handsomest of the chain <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>of squares which extend, almost
without a break, from Oxford street to the New
Road&mdash;Bloomsbury Square, Woburn Square, Gordon Square,
Tavistock Square, and Euston Square.&nbsp; The neighbourhood has
seen many strange shifts of fortune, and some of the finest of
its mansions are debased to the uses of common boarding-houses
and private hotels.&nbsp; There are streets and streets of houses
with white cards in the windows announcing &ldquo;Lodgings to
let.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sombre old houses they are, built of brick,
with flat, uninteresting fronts, the sooty darkness of which is
sometimes relieved by a yellowish portico, freshly painted, or a
plaster shell of a drab colour reaching from the basement to the
second story.&nbsp; The cheeriness of the spreading trees in the
little parks, the flowering shrubs, the shining fountains, and
the grass, are only a partial alleviation.&nbsp; Russell Square
has <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>deteriorated less than some of the other places in the
neighbourhood, however, and the houses around it would not be
beneath the inclinations of a prosperous merchant such as old
Sedley was.&nbsp; We look in vain for 96; the numbers do not go
as high as that; but we have no difficulty in singling out the
respectable dwelling on the western side in which poor Amelia
sighed for her selfish lover, and Becky Sharp set her cap at the
corpulent Mr. Jos.</p>
<p>How sad the story of the Sedleys is!&mdash;the unrequited love
of Amelia&mdash;the untimely death of George at
Waterloo&mdash;the failure of old Sedley, and the
cold-heartedness of the elder Osborne!&nbsp; The decayed merchant
musing over all sorts of fatuous schemes by which he hopes to
recover his position, and sitting in the dark corner of a
coffee-house with his letters spread out before him&mdash;letters
relating to a make-believe and <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>visionary business&mdash;which he is
anxious to read to every friend, is the most touching picture,
after the death of Colonel Newcome, which Thackeray has
drawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What guest at Dives&rsquo;s table can pass the familiar
house without a sigh?&mdash;the house of which the lights used to
shine so cheerfully at seven o&rsquo;clock&mdash;of which the
hall doors opened so readily&mdash;of which the obsequious
servants, as you passed up the comfortable stairs, sounded your
name from landing to landing, until it reached the apartment
where jolly old Dives welcomed his friends!&nbsp; What a number
of them he had!&nbsp; What a noble way of entertaining them! . .
. How changed is the house, though!&nbsp; The front is patched
over with bills, setting forth the particulars of the furniture
in staring capitals.&nbsp; They have hung a shred of carpet out
of the upstairs window&mdash;a half <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>dozen of porters are lounging on the
dirty steps&mdash;the hall swarms with dingy guests of oriental
countenance, who thrust printed cards into your hands, and offer
to bid.&nbsp; Old women and amateurs have invaded the upper
apartments, pinching the bed curtains, poking the feathers,
shampooing the mattresses, and clapping the wardrobe drawers to
and fro. . . . O Dives, who would have thought, as we sat round
the broad table sparkling with plate and spotless linen, to have
such a dish at the head of it as that roaring
auctioneer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the bidders was a six-foot, shy-looking military
gentleman, who bought a piano, and sent it without any message to
the little house&mdash;St. Adelaide Villa, Anna Maria Road,
West&mdash;to which the Sedleys had retired after their downfall,
and there, as the reader no doubt remembers, Amelia received it
with great gladness, believing <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>that it came from her well-beloved
George.</p>
<p>It was years before she discovered that it was not her
faithless lover, but simple, brave, tender-hearted Captain
Dobbin, to whom she should have been grateful.&nbsp; It was in
Hart street, two blocks nearer Oxford street than Russell Square,
that little George Osborne went to school at the house of the
Rev. Laurence Veal, domestic chaplain to the Earl of Bareacres,
who prepared young noblemen and gentlemen for the universities,
the senate, and the learned professions, whose system did not
embrace the degrading corporal severities still practiced at the
ancient places of education, and in whose family the pupils found
the elegancies of refined society, and the confidence and
affection of a home.&nbsp; Thither came poor Amelia, walking all
the way from Brompton to catch a glimpse of her darling boy, who
had been taken away from her by his obdurate grandfather.</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Great
Russell street is next to Hart street, and on it fronts the
classic portico of the British Museum, in the splendid
reading-room of which Thackeray was often seen.&nbsp; It was in
Great Coram street, adjoining the celebrated foundling hospital,
that he lived, when, one evening, he called on a young man who
had chambers in Furnival&rsquo;s Inn, and offered to illustrate
the works which were beginning to make &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; famous;
and we can see him coming back to his lodgings in low spirits
over the rejection of his proposal, for at that time Thackeray
was poor, and neither literature nor art, which he loved the
better, would support him.</p>
<p>About half a mile farther north, across Tottenham Court Road,
is Fitzroy Square; and when we look for 120, we find that 40 is
the highest number which the Square includes.&nbsp; Though the
little circular garden <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>which it incloses is prettily laid
out, and is one of the leafiest of the oases between Euston and
Bloomsbury, Fitzroy has degenerated more than some of the other
squares in the neighborhood.&nbsp; It was not very fashionable
when Colonel Newcome took No. 120 with James Binnie, and it is
not fashionable at all now.&nbsp; One side is badly out of
repair.&nbsp; There are two or three doctors&rsquo; houses in it,
several houses with announcements of apartments to let, and a
private hotel.&nbsp; The particular house occupied by the Colonel
and his old Indian friend cannot be easily identified by
Thackeray&rsquo;s description.&nbsp; &ldquo;The house is vast,
but, it must be owned, melancholy.&nbsp; Not long since, it was a
ladies&rsquo; school in an unprosperous condition.&nbsp; The scar
left by Madame Latour&rsquo;s brass plate may still be seen on
the tall black door, cheerfully ornamented in the style of the
end of the <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>last century, with a funereal urn in the centre of the
entry and garlands, and the skulls of rams at each
corner.&rdquo;&nbsp; We fancy that it was on the south side of
the square, near the middle of a row of heavy sepulchral houses
built of stone, which, first blackened by the London smoke, have
since been unevenly calcined by the atmosphere, so that, as in
many other buildings, they look as if a quantity of dirty
whitewash had been allowed to trickle down them.&nbsp; Some of
the ornaments have been removed, but the urn is still over the
door.</p>
<p>The days spent here were the happiest in the lives of the good
old Colonel and his son.&nbsp; The Colonel had just returned from
India full of honors and riches, and with his old chum, James
Binnie, he kept house with lavish hospitality, and much
originality.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Colonel was great at <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>making
hot-pot, curry, and pillau,&rdquo; Pendennis tells us.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What cozy pipes did we not smoke in the dining-room, in
the drawing-room, or where we would!&nbsp; What pleasant evenings
did we not have with Mr. Binnie&rsquo;s books and Schiedam!&nbsp;
Then there were solemn state dinners, at most of which the writer
of this biography had a corner.&rdquo;&nbsp; The guests at these
entertainments were not selected for their social position or
their worldly prosperity, and it mattered not whether they were
rich or poor, well dressed or shabby, if they were friends.&nbsp;
Old Indian Officers were among them, and young artists with
unkempt ways from Newman street and Berners street; the genial F.
B. waltzed with elderly houris and paid them compliments;
Professor Gandish talked about art with many misplaced h&rsquo;s,
and the Rev. Charles Honeyman sighed and posed <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>and meekly
received the adulation of the women.</p>
<p>Despite the failure of the Bundlecomb Bank, the later part of
the history of the Newcomes would have been less sad but for that
accident to Mr. Binnie, in which he fell from his horse and was
so much injured that Mrs. Mackenzie&mdash;the &ldquo;awful&rdquo;
campaigner&mdash;was called in to nurse him with the aid of poor
little Rosey.&nbsp; Fitzroy Square is so old that its gloomy
houses must have known much sorrow; but we doubt if any of them
has seen anything more pitiable than the humiliation of Colonel
Newcome, or anything crueller than the remorseless tyranny of the
&ldquo;campaigner&rdquo; and her fierce temper&mdash;the
&ldquo;campaigner,&rdquo; who was all smiles, coquetry, and
amiability, until prosperity fled from those who had been her
benefactors, when she suddenly revealed all the <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>pettiness and
harshness of her termagant soul.</p>
<p>Three streets away from the Square is Howland street, to which
Clive removed with his weak little wife and his spiteful
mother-in-law when disaster fell upon him; and every reader of
Thackeray will remember how Pendennis, Clive, and Boy went out to
meet the broken-hearted old man as he came along Guilford street
and Russell Square, from the Charterhouse to eat his last
Christmas dinner.</p>
<p>When we close the history of Colonel Newcome we ask ourselves
if any man who moves our hearts as Thackeray does, could be a
cynic?&nbsp; Cynicism is a withering of the heart, the exhaustion
of a shallow moral nature, the self-consciousness of an ignoble
mind.&nbsp; But what pathos is so spontaneous, so genuine, so
lasting as Thackeray&rsquo;s&mdash;so free from the literary
trickery which may <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>produce tears in youth, but only provokes a smile when
age has dulled the feelings and opened the eyes to
artifice.&nbsp; Among all English authors the writer of this
little book, at least, does not recognize one who is more
unaffectedly tender than this great Social preacher, who speaks
with unflinching candour of evil, but glorifies all good, and
reads with unfeigned pity the lessons of life.</p>
<h2><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>Before Thackeray died, he had become as familiar a figure in
the West End of London as Dr. Johnson was in Fleet street and its
tributary courts and lanes.&nbsp; Any one who did not know him
might have supposed him to be an indolent man about town; and
those who could identify him generally knew where to find him, if
they wished to show the great author to a friend from the
country.&nbsp; He was usually present in the Park at the
fashionable hour; and if the Pall Mall of his day is ever
painted, his face and form will be as inseparable from a truthful
picture as the mammoth bulk of <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>the testy lexicographer is from the
contemporaneous prints of old Temple Bar.</p>
<p>Pall Mall is the street of gentlemen, as Fleet Street was the
street of the ragged literary mendicants, whose wretched lot has
been drawn in vivid colours by Macauley.&nbsp; The people one
meets in it are daintily booted, gloved and hatted; a lady is not
often seen among them.&nbsp; It is, as Thackeray himself said,
&ldquo;the social exchange of London:&rdquo; the main artery of
Clubland, where civilized man has set up for himself all the
adjuncts of luxurious celibacy, and congregates to discuss,
undisturbed by the impertinencies of feminine lack-logic, the
news, the politics and the scandal of the hour.&nbsp; It is old
and historic, haunted by the shadows of many odd and famous
persons, who reshape themselves unbidden in the memory of those
who know its annals.&nbsp; The reminiscences bring out a motley
<a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>tenancy
from the houses&mdash;Culloden, Cumberland and Gainsborough side
by side, pretty Eleanor Gwynn and Queen Caroline, Sarah
Marlborough and genial Walter Scott, George Selwyn and Dick
Steele, Sheridan and William Pitt, Walpole and Joseph Addison,
and Fox and the Prince Regent!&nbsp; The greensward at the south
end of the Athen&aelig;um Club was a part of the site of Carlton
House, the residence of the royal scapegrace, and we see
Thackeray, as he has described himself, a frilled and petticoated
urchin in his nurse&rsquo;s care, peeping through the colonnade
at the guards, as they pace before the palace, and salute the
royal chariots coming in and out.&nbsp; Before he reached manhood
the palace had disappeared, and many of the old buildings in Pall
Mall had been pulled down to make room for the magnificent club
houses, which now give <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>the street its distinctive
character.&nbsp; Not one of the new faces that appeared with the
alterations was more familiar to the men of his time than his,
and among all the princes, dandies, politicians, and scholars who
filed through the street and nodded to one another from their
club windows, there was not one to whom the reading part of this
generation reverts with greater fondness than to Thackeray.</p>
<p>Those who appreciate his books&mdash;a constantly increasing
number&mdash;find it difficult to understand how the author can
be so misinterpreted as to be accused of any narrowness of view
or harshness of judgment.&nbsp; To them every line is testimony
of a fatherly tenderness which grieves at the necessity of its
own rebuke, and though he is incapable of an apathetic
acquiescence in human weakness, and does not view mankind with
the lazy good nature of a <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>neutral temper, the pervading spirit
of his criticism springs from a deep-welled charitableness.</p>
<p>One of the few stories told of him which would dispute his
invariable kindliness is of two friends who were walking in the
West End when they saw Thackeray approaching them from the
opposite direction.&nbsp; One of them had met him before, and the
other had not.&nbsp; The former made a demonstrative salutation,
which the author barely acknowledged as he loftily passed
along.&nbsp; &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe that he sat up
with us drinking punch and singing <i>Dr. Martin Luther</i> until
three o&rsquo;clock this morning,&rdquo; said the person, who
felt aggrieved at his chilling reception, to his friend.&nbsp;
Now supposing that the story is authentic&mdash;that two friends
did meet him under those circumstances, and that one of them had
been a sharer of his conviviality in the small <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>hours, a
further claim on his recognition was not necessarily justified,
and he did not violate any rule of good breeding in discouraging
it.&nbsp; But there are some who feel emboldened by the smallest
politeness of a great man to consider themselves intimate with
him, and who once having seen him come down from his pedestal to
smoke a cutty pipe in a miscellaneous company ever afterwards
look upon him as a comrade.</p>
<p>The loveableness of his character is well remembered at the
Athen&aelig;um Club, and the old servants, especially, speak of
his kindness to them.&nbsp; The club house is at the corner of
Waterloo Place and Pall Mall&mdash;a drab-coloured, sedate,
classic building, with a wide frieze under the cornice&mdash;in a
line with the Guards, the Oxford and Cambridge, the Reform, the
Traveller&rsquo;s, and many other clubs.&nbsp; Opposite to it is
the <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>United
Service Club, midway is the memorial column to the Duke of York,
and only a few yards away are Carlton Terrace and the steps
leading into St. James&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; Marlborough House, the
home of the Prince of Wales, and unpalatial St. James&rsquo;s
Palace, are close by.</p>
<p>Thackeray&rsquo;s name appears on the roll of the
Athen&aelig;um as that of a barrister; but he was elected in 1851
as &ldquo;author of <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Pendennis</i>, and
other well-known works of fiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was elected under Rule II., which is worth quoting, as it
is designed to preserve the character of the Club.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It being essential to the maintenance of the
Athen&aelig;um, in conformity with the principles upon which it
was originally founded, that the annual introduction of a certain
number of persons of distinguished eminence in Science,
Literature or the Arts, or <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>for Public Services, should be
secured, a limited number of persons of such qualifications shall
be elected by the Committee.&nbsp; The number so elected shall
not exceed Nine each year . . . The Club intrust this privilege
to the Committee, in the entire confidence that they will only
elect persons who have attained to distinguished eminence in
Science, Literature, or the Arts, or for Public
Services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He used the club both for work and pleasure, and there are two
corners of the building to which his name has become attached, on
account of his association with them.&nbsp; The dining-room is on
the first floor, at the left-hand side of the spacious entrance;
and he usually sat at a table in the nearest corner, where the
sun shines plenteously through the high windows, and makes
rainbows on the white cloth in striking the glasses.&nbsp;
Theodore <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>Hook had used the same table, and uncorked his wit with
his wine at it; but it was in a kindlier strain than the author
of <i>Jack Brag</i> was capable of that Thackeray enlivened the
friends who gathered around him.</p>
<p>From the Club window he probably saw many of his own
characters going along Pall Mall: little Barnes Newcome; Fred
Bayham, with his big whiskers; cumbrous Rawdon Crawley; the
sinister Marquis of Steyne; stylish little Foker; neat Major
Pendennis; homely William Dobbin, and the dashing Dr. Brand
Firmin, as he drove up or down the Haymarket to or from Old Parr
street.&nbsp; Most of them belonged to the fashionable or
semi-fashionable world, and the men were sure to be members of
some of the clubs in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; No doubt he also
saw Arthur Pendennis, Clive Newcome, and Philip Firmin; but it is
<a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>likely
that they appeared with the greatest distinctness when the blinds
were drawn and the reflection of his own face was visible in the
darkened windows.</p>
<p>He was a <i>bon vivant</i>: fond of a nice little dinner, a
connoisseur of wines, the devotee of a good cigar, a willing
receiver of many little pleasures which an ascetic judgment would
pronounce wasteful and slothful.&nbsp; He was inclined to be
indolent and luxurious.&nbsp; Had he not lost his fortune, and
been urged by necessity to write, it is to be feared that his
splendid gifts would never have been exercised, and that his
genius would have borne no more fruit than an unworked store of
unformulated and unanalysed mental impressions, known only to
himself.&nbsp; But his liking for choice little dinners was not
wholly accountable to his relish of the food or to the
satisfaction of thus gratifying the senses.&nbsp; No reproach of
<a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>excess or
grossness of any kind attaches to his character.&nbsp; Though
perhaps he was self-indulgent, he was not a voluptuary.&nbsp; His
pleasure was as innocent as that of Colonel Newcome when he
visited the smoky depths of Bohemia with young Clive, and the
dinner was but the means of sociability and hospitality, the
preparation for a more intellectual treat, a key to the fetters
which keep some hearts and minds in this oddly-constituted and
misgiving world from the openness and confidence of
brotherhood.</p>
<p>It was not a cold or formal honour that was conferred upon
those who sat with him.&nbsp; When they were taken into his
confidence, no friend could be more jovial or unrestrained than
he was.&nbsp; The simplicity of the man was one of his greatest
charms.&nbsp; He could not endure affectations and
mannerisms.&nbsp; He talked without effort, without <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>hesitation,
and without any of the elaborateness which comes of egotistic
cogitation, and the desire to present oneself in the most
favourable light.&nbsp; He was one of the most
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; of men, if the word is taken as meaning the
absence of self-disguise; and at these little dinners and in the
smoke-room, figuratively speaking, he usually had his slippers
on, and his feet stretched out on the hearth-rug. <a
name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a></p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>The
modern smoking-room of the Club is under the garden, upon which
the dining room of Carlton House once stood; but in
Thackeray&rsquo;s time a very small apartment near the top of the
building, served for those addicted to the dreamy weed, and he
was among them.&nbsp; He was not a great smoker, though he
usually had a cigar at hand; he coquetted with it, puffed at it
awhile and watched the blue wreaths vanishing towards the
ceiling, and then put it down, or let it go out.&nbsp; He did not
apply himself to it with the constancy and caressing intentness
of complete enjoyment, but was <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>fitful, as if the pleasure he derived
was dubious.</p>
<p>Much of the pleasure of his life was dubious.&nbsp; We have
here seen but one side of his character, the geniality which was
unextinguished by an inherent sadness of temperament: the
comfortableness of his hours of relaxation.&nbsp; But he was not
a happy man, even when he had achieved success, and his powers
had been fully recognized.&nbsp; Self-confidence is an ingredient
of genius which was lacking in him.&nbsp; He was always in doubt
about his work, he trusted his judgment when he discovered
defects in it, but never felt sure of its merits.&nbsp; More
distressing than all else was his procrastination: the
heart-breaking and peace-destroying spectre of postponed work was
too often before him, and he was often crippled by his hesitation
and despair.</p>
<p>The south-west corner of the South <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>library, on the second floor of the
Club, is filled with books of English history, and some of his
work was done there.&nbsp; Therefrom, no doubt, some of the
material of the lectures on the Georges was drawn; he could look
out of the window on the very site of Carlton House, now a square
of grass and flowers; and probably on these shelves he found some
help in completing <i>Esmond</i> and developing <i>The
Virginians</i>.&nbsp; He often left the library looking fatigued
and troubled, and he was sometimes heard complaining of the
perplexity he found in disposing of this character or that, and
asserting that he knew that what he was writing would fail.</p>
<p>He divided his time between the Athen&aelig;um Club, the
Reform, and the Garrick.&nbsp; Contiguous to the first two is the
neighborhood of St. James&rsquo;s, which principally consists of
clubs, bachelors&rsquo; chambers, and <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>fashionable shops, and is associated
with many of Thackeray&rsquo;s characters.&nbsp; At No. 88 St.
James&rsquo;s street, in a building now demolished, he himself
once occupied chambers, and there began and finished <i>Barry
Lyndon</i>.&nbsp; Major Pendennis had chambers in Bury street, a
narrow lane coming from Piccadilly parallel with St.
James&rsquo;s street; and it was in them that the famous scene
took place between the shrewd old soldier and Mr. Morgan, in
which that rebellious flunky was brought whining to his knees by
the strategic courage of his master.&nbsp; We have searched the
neighbourhood for the &ldquo;Wheel of Fortune&rdquo;
public-house, which Mr. Morgan frequented to discuss with other
gentlemen&rsquo;s gentlemen, gentlemen&rsquo;s affairs.&nbsp; It
is not to be found; and Bury street has scarcely a house in it
that looks old enough to have been the Major&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But
St. James&rsquo;s Church is here&mdash;a gloomy old building of
<a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>smoky
brick with lighter trimmings of stone; and the reader may
remember how, one day, Esmond and Dick Steele were walking along
Jermyn street after dinner at the Guards&rsquo;, when they espied
a fair, tall man in a snuff-coloured suit, with a plain sword,
very sober, and almost shabby in appearance, who was poring over
a folio volume at a book-shop close by the church; and how Dick,
shining in scarlet and gold lace, rushed up to the student and
took him in his arms and hugged him; and how the object of these
demonstrations proved to be Addison, who invited Steele and
Esmond to his chambers in the Haymarket, where he read verses of
the <i>Campaign</i> to them, and regaled them with pipes and
Burgundy.&nbsp; I never walk through Jermyn street, or past the
old church, without seeing these three figures, and they are no
more <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>like
shadows than any in the nineteenth century throng which fills the
street.</p>
<p>Willis&rsquo;s Rooms, formerly Almack&rsquo;s, are in King
street, which is parallel to Jermyn street, and it was in them,
that Thackeray gave his lectures.</p>
<h2><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>VIII.</h2>
<p>Thackeray constantly mixes up real with fictitious names in
his descriptions.&nbsp; Some disguise was often necessary, and
sometimes even compulsory.&nbsp; He could not be as explicit or
as literal as Dickens, because most of his characters represented
a very different class.&nbsp; The latter could draw in detail the
house he selected as most appropriate for the occupation of
Sairey Gamp, because the actual tenants were not likely to find
him out, or, if they ever read his description, to quarrel with
it.&nbsp; But many of the clients whom Thackeray had to provide
with dwellings were great people, and <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>could only be placed in great
neighbourhoods, where the houses are large, conspicuous, and
easily distinguished.&nbsp; He either had to omit any descriptive
detail, or to mask the actual place he had in mind by locating it
in some street or square with a fanciful name.&nbsp; Any student
of his works will have no difficulty, however, in finding Gaunt
House, Gaunt Square, and Great Gaunt street, if he makes a
personal search for them in Mayfair, though they are not
indicated in any map or directory.</p>
<p>Mayfair (let me say for the benefit of my readers who are so
unfortunate as not to knew London) is one of the three most
fashionable neighbourhoods of the great metropolis, and of the
three it is the most aristocratic and most ancient.&nbsp; It is,
as nearly as possible, a square, about half a mile wide and
three-quarters of a mile long, bounded at one end by Oxford <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>street, with
its shops and plebeian traffic, at the other end by the most
delightful of London streets, Piccadilly; at one side by Bond
street, and at the other by Park Lane, the houses in which
overlook the beautiful expanse of Hyde Park.&nbsp; The names of
some of its streets have become synonymous with patrician pomp
and the affluence of inheritance.&nbsp; It is the highest heaven
of social aspiration, the most exalted object of worldly
veneration.&nbsp; This is the house of the Duke of Hawksbury;
this of the Earl of Tue-brook; that of Viscount Wallasey, and
that of Lord Arthur Bebbington.&nbsp; It is pre&euml;minently the
region of the &ldquo;quality.&rdquo;&nbsp; But let not the reader
suppose that it is a region of exterior splendor, of spacious
architecture, of brilliant appearance.</p>
<p>Belgravia is far grander to look at, and seems to possess
greater riches, and to use <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>them more lavishly.&nbsp; Even
Tyburnia, the neighborhood to the north of Hyde Park, is more
suggestive of social eminence.&nbsp; Mayfair displays none of the
signs of the rude enjoyment and proud assertiveness which spring
from recent prosperity.&nbsp; It is old-fashioned, un-changing,
and dull.&nbsp; It is little different from what it was at the
beginning of the century, except that it is nearer decay, and
that febrile irruptions of modern Queen Anne architecture
occasionally vary the sombreness of its original style.&nbsp; The
physiognomy of its houses expresses a sort of torpor, as if
familiarity with honours were as wearisome as continuous
association with misfortune.&nbsp; They have an air of funereal
resignation.&nbsp; Many of the streets are short and narrow: many
of the houses are dingy.&nbsp; The ornaments are of a sepulchral
kind, such as urns over the door-ways, and funeral wreaths about
<a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>the
porticoes.&nbsp; The blazoned heraldry of the hatchments has been
nearly extinguished by the smoke.&nbsp; At some doors there are
two incongruous obelisks, joined to the iron railing which
screens the basement, and the portico is extended to the
curb.&nbsp; But ornaments even as unsatisfactory as these are not
common, and most of the houses, with high fronts of blackened
brick and oblong windows, are unadorned, except by a few boxes of
flowers on the sills.&nbsp; The lackeys, with crimson
knee-breeches, white stockings, laced coats, buckled shoes, and
powdered hair, blaze in this gloom with a pyrotechnic
splendour.&nbsp; Occasionally, the uniform rows of smoky brick
and pointed stucco houses are overshadowed by a larger mansion,
shut within its own walls, and some of the streets enter spacious
squares, where there are sooty trees and grass and chirping
sparrows.</p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>It is
possible that Thackeray had no exact place in mind when he wrote
of Gaunt House and Gaunt Square, but it is not likely.&nbsp; The
creatures of his imagination were flesh and blood to him, too
vital to be left without habitations.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the world
knows,&rdquo; he says in <i>Vanity Fair</i>, &ldquo;that Gaunt
House stands in Gaunt Square, out of which Great Gaunt street
leads . . . Gaunt House occupies nearly a side of the
square.&nbsp; The remaining three sides consist of mansions which
have passed away into dowagerism. . . .&nbsp; It has a dreary
look, nor is Lord Steyne&rsquo;s palace less dreary.&nbsp; All to
be seen of it is a vast wall in front, with rustic columns at the
great gate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Berkeley Square almost exactly
corresponds with this description.&nbsp; Here are the gloomy
mansions, looking out on grass and trees which seem to belong to
a cemetery, and <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>here, immediately recognizable, is the palace, filling
nearly a side of the square, and shut within high walls to hide
what they inclose from the prying eyes of the passers, though the
upper stories can be seen from the opposite side of the
way.&nbsp; Here is the very gate, with heavy knockers, though the
rustic columns of Thackeray&rsquo;s text have been replaced by
new ones of a different shape.&nbsp; We do not find in the middle
of the square the statue of Lord Gaunt, &ldquo;in a three-tailed
wig, and otherwise habited like a Roman emperor,&rdquo; but we
can identify almost every other detail of the picture.&nbsp; Now,
as this palace has long been occupied by a noble family, it would
not be just for us to mention the name of the house, lest some
undeserved reproach should thereby fall on the tenants; for,
while Thackeray described the locality with such faithful
elaboration <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>it is not to be inferred that he drew the character of
Lord Steyne from an actual person living in the neighbourhood;
nothing indeed, could be less probable.</p>
<p>He also speaks of the square as Shiverley Square, and briefly
mentions it in describing Becky&rsquo;s drive to the house of Sir
Pitt Crawley: &ldquo;Having passed through Shiverley Square into
Great Gaunt street, the carriage at length stopped at a tall,
gloomy house, between two other tall, gloomy houses, each with a
hatchment over the middle drawing-room window, as is the custom
in Great Gaunt street, in which gloomy locality death seems to
reign perpetual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great Gaunt street is undoubtedly Hill street, which he
mentions specifically in another place as the home of Lady
Gaunt&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; Sometimes it was necessary for him to
invent a name, and when he did so <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>he was peculiarly apt.&nbsp; Gaunt
Square seems a more fitting and descriptive name than Berkeley
Square, but he frequently varied the real with the fictitious
name with playful caprice.</p>
<p>It was in another of these queer old streets in Mayfair that
that wicked old fairy godmother, the Countess of Kew, lived, and
there (in Queen street) Ethel Newcome visited her, and was
instructed in the rigourous social code which unites fortune with
fortune, or fortune with rank, and which is by no means limited
to Mayfair or Belgravia, but finds expositors and adherents under
the bluer skies of America.&nbsp; Ethel herself lived with her
mother in Park Lane, the western boundary of Mayfair, and
assuredly the most attractive part of the region.&nbsp; Park Lane
has all of Hyde Park before its windows,&mdash;all the variegated
and plentifully stocked flower-beds of the <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Ring Road,
the wide sweep of grassy playground, and the knots of patriarchal
trees which give the Park one of its greatest charms.&nbsp;
Unlike most of the region behind it is cheerful; or, if not
exactly cheerful, it has not the mopish signs of withdrawal from
all natural human interests which are seen in many of the houses
in Gaunt Square and the tributary streets.&nbsp; Some of the
houses are small, with oriel windows, and little balconies filled
with flower-pots; some of them are palatial in size and
decoration; but all of them are fashionable, and elderly
bachelors are known to give incredibly large prices for the
smallest possible quarters under the roof of the meanest of
them.&nbsp; The exteriors are not of the sooty brick which
characterizes Hill street, but of plaster, which is annually
repainted in drab or cream colour at the beginning of each
season.&nbsp; What with the flowers of <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>the Park and the gardens which lie
before some of the houses, Park Lane seems a fitting abode for
those who are fortunate both in birth and in wealth; it is as
patrician as any other part of Mayfair, and it relieves itself of
the gloom which seems to be considered an inevitable accessory of
respectability elsewhere.</p>
<p>In one of these houses&mdash;which one it is not easy to say,
as Thackeray has given us no clue&mdash;Lady Ann Newcome lived,
and at it Mrs. Hobson Newcome looked from afar with an envy which
betrayed itself in her constant reiterations of her contentment
with her own circumstances.&nbsp; Mrs. Hobson lived in Bryanston
Square, a dingily verdant quadrangle north of Oxford street, near
which Clive had a studio; and J. J. Ridley, Fred Bayham, Miss
Cann, and the Rev. Charles Honeyman, lodged together in Walpole
street, Mayfair.&nbsp; The Rev. <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>Charles Honeyman&rsquo;s chapel was
close by, and before the story of <i>Vanity Fair</i> reached its
end there was a charitable lady in the congregation who wrote
hymns and called herself Lady Crawley, and from whom William
Dobbin and Amelia Sedley, now united, shrunk as they passed her
at the fancy fair, recognizing in that altered person the
dreadful Becky.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the lover of Thackeray, no character of history
or fiction has lent more interest to Mayfair than Becky, to which
neighbourhood she came with her husband some two or three years
after their return from Paris, establishing herself in &ldquo;a
very small, comfortable house in Curzon street,&rdquo; and
demonstrating to the world the useful and interesting art of
living on nothing a year.&nbsp; There is more than one small
house in Curzon street, but among them all Becky&rsquo;s is
unmistakable.&nbsp; It is <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>on the south side of the street, near
the western end, and only a few doors farther east than the house
in which Lord Beaconsfield died.&nbsp; It is four stories and a
half high, and is built of blackish brick like its neighbours,
with painted sills and portico.&nbsp; Its extreme narrowness,
compared with its height, especially distinguishes it: the front
door, with drab pilasters and a moulded architrave, is just half
its width, and only leaves room for one parlour window on the
first floor.&nbsp; One can see over the railings into the
basement and through the kitchen windows.&nbsp; Phantoms appear
to us in all the windows&mdash;the ghost of Becky herself,
dressed in a pink dress, her shapely arms and shoulders wrapped
in gauze; her ringlets hanging about her neck; her feet peeping
out of the crisp folds of silk&mdash;&ldquo;the prettiest little
feet in the prettiest little sandals in the finest silk stockings
<a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>in the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in this cozy little domicile that the
arch little hypocrite entertained Lord Steyne, whose house in
Gaunt Square is only a few hundred yards distant, and Rawdon
fleeced young Southdown at cards.&nbsp; No one can help smiling
at the remembrances that come upon him in looking at those
basement windows.&nbsp; No one who has read <i>Vanity Fair</i> is
likely to forget the picture of the sensual marquis gazing into
the kitchen and seeing no one there just before he knocks at the
door, where he is met by Becky, who is as fresh as a rose from
her dressing-table, and who excuses her pretended dishabille by
saying that she has just come out of the kitchen, where she has
been making pie, to which palpable lie the marquis gives an
audacious affirmation by adding that he saw her there as he came
in!</p>
<p>This little house was chosen for that <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>scene in
which Thackeray&rsquo;s genius rises to its highest point of
dramatic intensity; and so many literary pilgrims come to peep at
it that the tenants must be annoyed, though the policeman on the
beat has become so accustomed to them that he no longer eyes them
cornerwise or suspects them of burglarious intentions.</p>
<h2><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>IX.</h2>
<p>The places with which Thackeray was personally associated are
more interesting, perhaps, than the scenes of his novels.&nbsp;
In 1834, he lived in Albion street, near Hyde Park Gardens, and
it was there that he, a young man of twenty-three, began to
contribute to <i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i>.&nbsp; In 1837, then
newly married, he lived in Great Coram street, close by the
Foundling Hospital.&nbsp; As I have stated, he had chambers at
No. 10, Crown Office Row, in the Temple, and at No. 88, St.
James&rsquo;s street, both of which buildings are now
demolished.&nbsp; When he had become a successful author, <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>he lived in
Brompton and Kensington, and at the latter place, to which he was
greatly attached, he died.&nbsp; He was at No. 36, Onslow Square,
Brompton, when he unsuccessfully offered himself as member of
Parliament for Oxford, and two years later, when he began to
discover the thorns in the editorial cushion of the <i>Cornhill
Magazine</i>.&nbsp; Mr. James Hodder, his private secretary, has
given us an interesting glimpse of him as he was while in Onslow
Square:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Duty called me to his bed-chamber every
morning, and as a general rule I found him up and ready to begin
work, though he was sometimes in doubt and difficulty as to
whether he should commence sitting, or standing, or walking, or
lying down.&nbsp; Often he would light a cigar, and, after pacing
the room for a few minutes, would put the unsmoked remnant on the
mantel-piece and resume his work with increased cheerfulness, as
if <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>he
gathered fresh inspiration from the gentle odours of the sublime
tobacco.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Little wonder that he liked Kensington.&nbsp; It is the
pleasantest of the many pleasant London suburbs.&nbsp; Though it
is not four miles from Charing Cross, to which it is knitted by
continuous streets and houses, it is like a thriving country
town, old-fashioned, but prosperous, with shops as brilliant and
as well stocked as those of Regent street, and with many
evidences of antiquity, but none of decay.&nbsp; There are lofty
new buildings and old ones, behind the modernized fronts of which
you can see leaded dormer windows, angular chimney-pots, and
bowed-down roofs of red tiles.&nbsp; There are many weather-worn
but splendid mansions shut within their own high walls, and some
in less sequestered gardens.&nbsp; The place is famous for its
fine old trees and open spaces of verdure.&nbsp; Holland House is
<a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>here, and
the palace in which Queen Victoria was born, with the beautiful
and deeply wooded gardens adjoining Hyde Park.&nbsp; The
inhabitants of the old suburb have had many illustrious persons
among them; and Thackeray is one of those best and most
affectionately remembered.</p>
<p>His tall, commanding figure was often seen in the old High
street, moving along erect, with a firm, stately tread, though
his dress was somewhat careless and loose-fitting; his large,
candid face was serious and almost severe as he walked on engaged
in meditation, but, being awakened from his reverie by the voice
of a friend, a glad smile quickly overspread it and illuminated
it.&nbsp; He had many friends among his neighbors, and often sat
down to dinner with them.&nbsp; He attended regularly the nine
o&rsquo;clock services in the old parish church on Sunday
mornings.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>From
1847 to 1853, Thackeray lived in the bay-windowed house known as
the &ldquo;Cottage,&rdquo; at No. 13 (now No. 16) Young street,
and in it <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Esmond</i>, and <i>Pendennis</i>
were written.&nbsp; There are few houses in the great city which
possess a more brilliant record than this.&nbsp; Most of his work
was done in a second-story room, overlooking an open space of
gardens and orchards; and the gentleman who at present occupies
the house has placed an entablature under the window
commemorating the genius that has consecrated it.&nbsp; Between
the dates, 1847 and 1853, the initials W. M. T. are grouped in a
monogram in the centre of the entablature, and in the border the
names of <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Esmond</i>, and <i>Pendennis</i>,
are inscribed.&nbsp; Just across the street Miss Thackeray (Mrs.
Ritchie) now lives, in full view of her old home, and in her
charming novel <i>Old </i><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span><i>Kensington</i>, she affectionately
calls Young street &ldquo;dear old street!&rdquo;&nbsp; There is
no doubt that the happiest years of Thackeray&rsquo;s life were
spent in the old, bow-windowed cottage. <a
name="citation99"></a><a href="#footnote99"
class="citation">[99]</a></p>
<p>I have talked with many persons who knew him intimately, and
under various circumstances.&nbsp; All speak of him in one
way,&mdash;of his gentleness, his kindliness, his sincerity, and
his generosity.&nbsp; &ldquo;That man had the heart of a
woman!&rdquo; fervidly said one who was his next-door neighbour
for several years.&nbsp; This gentleman, Dr. J. J. <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Merriman,
whose family have lived in Kensington Square since 1794,
possesses a number of valuable souvenirs of the great author,
including some unpublished letters, in one of which Thackeray
regrets that he has not seen the doctor for some time, and
characteristically adds: &ldquo;I wish <i>Vanity Fair</i> were
not so big or we performers in it so busy; then we might see each
other and shake hands once in a year or so.&rdquo;&nbsp; On one
occasion the doctor begged him to write his name in a copy of
<i>Vanity Fair</i> which Thackeray had given him, and the latter
not only did this, but made an exquisite little drawing on the
title-page, than which the book could not have a more suggestive
or appropriate frontispiece.&nbsp; A little boy and girl are
seated on the ground, one blowing bubbles and the other hugging a
doll, while behind them looms up the portentous mile-stone of
life.</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>The
&ldquo;dear old street,&rdquo; as Miss Thackeray calls it, ends
in Kensington Square, which is full of old houses, to each of
which some historic interest belongs.&nbsp; The square was built
in the latter part of the seventeenth century, and in one of the
old houses Lady Castlewood, Beatrice, and Colonel Esmond lived,
and there sheltered the reckless and unscrupulous Pretender. <a
name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a></p>
<p>In 1853, Thackeray left Kensington and went to live in Onslow
Square, Brompton; but he came back to the old court suburb in
1861, and occupied the fine new house which he had built for
himself in the Palace Gardens.&nbsp; It is the second house on
the west side of the street, a substantial mansion of red brick,
adjoining a much more <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>picturesque and older house covered
with ivy; and it was here that he died suddenly on December 24,
1863, in the room at the south-east corner of the second
story.&nbsp; The last time that I saw it, an auctioneer&rsquo;s
flag was hung out, and the broker&rsquo;s men were playing
billiards in the lofty northern extension which Thackeray built
for a library, and in which he wrote <i>Denis Duval</i>.</p>
<p>Thackeray was buried in Kensal Green cemetery in the
north-west of London, and was followed to the grave by Dickens,
Browning, Millais, Trollope, and many who knew the goodness of
the soul that had been called away.&nbsp; Kensal Green is as
unattractive as a burial ground could be.&nbsp; It is like a
prison-yard, with few trees, and inclosed by high brick
walls.&nbsp; But its numerous tenantry include many who have
worked faithfully and well in literature and <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>art; and
surrounded by the memorials of these is one of the simplest
tombstones in the place, inscribed with two dates and the name of
William Makepeace Thackeray.</p>

then in London, met Thackeray in the street.&nbsp; The novelist
was serious in manner, and his looks and voice told of weariness
and affliction.&nbsp; He saw the kindly inquiry in the
poet&rsquo;s eyes, and said, &ldquo;Come into Evans&rsquo;s, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&nbsp; <i>I have killed the
Colonel</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; So they walked in, and took a table in
a remote corner, and then Thackeray, drawing the fresh sheets of
MS. from his breast pocket, read through that exquisitely
touching chapter, which records the death of Colonel
Newcome.&nbsp; When he came to the final <i>Adsum</i>, the tears
which had been swelling his lids for some time, trickled down his

crossing over to shake hands with him.&nbsp; &lsquo;O! that

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
